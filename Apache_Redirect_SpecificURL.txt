RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^/bla https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]

This is a fairly generic form that'll work for any HTTP Host (as I don't know any details about your host) 
and will redirect anything that matches with bla at the start of the URL and isn't already Https, with arguments 
and everything.


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11649944/apache-httpd-conf-for-redirecting-ip-to-hostname

<VirtualHost XX.XX.XX.XX>

DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
#ServerName ayz-abc.mysite.com/

 # Other directives here
 RewriteEngine On
 RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^ayz-abc.mysite.com$
 RewriteRule /.* https://ayz-abc.mysite.com/ [R]

</VirtualHost>
If you don't include this condition it will redirect even with the hostname


(Example from Web Servers)

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/in_service.html
RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]


http://10.247.79.38/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp

http://10.247.79.38/HSRM/csp/logon.csp


(ssl.conf)

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^/csp https://gov-tic-dev-hsrm.ccra.va.gov%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
RewriteRule ^/HSRM https://gov-tic-dev-hsrm.ccra.va.gov%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]


http://10.247.79.38/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp -> https://gov-tic-dev-hsrm.ccra.va.gov/csp/sys/UtilHome.csp 

http://10.247.79.38/HSRM/csp/logon.csp -> https://gov-tic-dev-hsrm.ccra.va.gov/HSRM/csp/logon.csp
